PoodLL Online Assignment
========================================
Thanks for downloading PoodLL.

Installation instructions and a video can be found at http://www.poodll.com .

There should be only one folder "poodllonline" in the poodllonline folder after you unzip the zip file.
Place this folder into your moodle installation under the [site_root]/mod/assignment/type folder.

Then login to your site as admin and go to your Moodle site's top page. Moodle should then guide you through the installation or upgrade of the PoodLL Online assignment. 
*Please be aware that the PoodLL Online assignment relies on the PoodLL Filter being installed, and won't work properly otherwise*

Then when you go to create an activity you should see a new assignment type, Poodll Online, in the list. 

Good luck.
