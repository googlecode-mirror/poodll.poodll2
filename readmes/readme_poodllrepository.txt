PoodLL Repository
========================================
Thanks for downloading PoodLL.

Installation instructions and a video can be found at http://www.poodll.com .

There should be only one folder "poodll" in the poodllrepository after you unzip the zip file.
Place this folder into your moodle installation under the [site_root]/repository folder.

Then login to your site as admin and go to your Moodle site's top page. Moodle should then guide you through the installation or upgrade of the PoodLL repository. Before you can use the repository you will have to create one or more instances of it, probably one for audio recording and one for video recording.

*Please be aware that the repository relies on the PoodLL Filter being installed, and won't work properly otherwise*

Good luck.
