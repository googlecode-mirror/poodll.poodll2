PoodLL All
========================================
Thanks for downloading PoodLL.

Installation instructions and a video can be found at http://www.poodll.com .

The files in the poodllall archive are all in the necessary directory structure. It should simply be necessary to upload the five directories into the root of your Moodle installation. No core Moodle files will be overriden or removed when doing this.
-mod
-filter
-repository
-question
-lib

Then login to your site as admin and go to your Moodle site's top page. Moodle should then guide you through the installation or upgrade of the 4 mods.

Good luck.
